In 2016 and 2017, we worked on many projects, but they seemingly had little to do with design. Through conversations with the design show’s sponsor Zhou Chenchen, we gained an understanding of the show’s intention. We thought, maybe we could do something that we were actually interested in.</div><div><br></div><div>We are a team based in Xiamen, but since many of our projects took place in Shanghai, I was searching for an apartment in Shanghai.

I found some apartments under 8000 RMB on lianjia.com (an intermediary website), many of them were 1-room apartments that are common in Shanghai, and some showed the tastes of the
